# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project investigates the reasons behind customer churn and provides actionable insights to reduce attrition. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualizations, and the development of a dashboard for decision-makers.

# The dataset contains 26 columns, with details about customer demographics, service usage, and churn behavior. Key fields include:

- Demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents.
- Services: InternetService, OnlineSecurity, PhoneService, etc.
- Behavioral Data: Tenure, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.
- Churn Indicators: Churn (Yes/No) and Tenure group.

# Key Findings from the Churn Data Analysis:
**Overall Churn Rate**:
- Out of the dataset, approximately 27% of customers have churned, highlighting a significant retention issue.

**Demographics and Churn**:
- Senior citizens show a slightly higher churn rate compared to younger customers.
- Customers without dependents or partners churn more frequently, suggesting possible stress from higher perceived costs.

**Service Type and Churn**:
- Customers using DSL or Fiber Optic internet services are at greater risk of churn, especially those with Fiber Optic.
- Additional services like online security, tech support, and device protection reduce churn rates significantly.

**Tenure and Churn**:
- Churn rates are disproportionately higher among customers with less than 12 months of tenure, suggesting early dissatisfaction.
- Customers with 3+ years of tenure churn far less often, pointing to improved satisfaction over time.

**Financial Insights**:
- Monthly charges are significantly higher for churned customers ($74.44) compared to those retained ($61.27).
- Customers opting for automatic payments show lower churn rates compared to those paying manually.

# Recommendations to Address Customer Churn:
## Focus on New Customers:
- Implement personalized onboarding for customers in their first year to address dissatisfaction.
- Offer discounts or free trials of premium services during this period.

## Enhance Value for Money:
- Review pricing strategies for Fiber Optic users, as high costs correlate with increased churn.
- Promote bundled services (e.g., Internet + Online Security) to improve perceived value.

## Boost Loyalty Programs:
- Reward long-tenure customers through loyalty discounts or perks to encourage extended contracts.

## Proactive Retention Efforts:
- Use predictive analytics to identify customers likely to churn based on tenure and service usage patterns.
- Offer exclusive deals or discounts to high-risk customers before contract renewal.

Payment Automation Incentives:
- Encourage customers to switch to automatic payments through discounts or perks, which reduces churn likelihood.

# Storytelling Example for Decision-Makers:
Imagine a customer named Sarah, a new subscriber to your Fiber Optic service. Excited about faster internet, she quickly realizes her monthly charges are higher than expected, and she struggles to navigate the complex billing process. After six months, overwhelmed and dissatisfied, Sarah decides to leave.

Now imagine an alternate reality: Sarah receives a welcome call upon signing up, along with a detailed guide on managing her plan. She’s offered a six-month discount on bundled online security services, reducing her overall costs. Six months later, Sarah feels valued and empowered, choosing to stay for the long haul.

This is the journey we aim to replicate for every customer. By understanding their pain points and addressing them with targeted strategies, we can transform churn risks into loyal relationships.
